Here will live my own programming language lol :)

That's gonna be fun.

## Stuff here
For educational purposes:

`./compile` compiles the code (resulting in assembly file(s) with `.s` extension)

`./build` builds the project—compiles, assembles and links, preserving assembly file(s) for inspection

`./run` runs the project–builds the project and executes the output binary
